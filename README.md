TANKS AI

The aim of this project is to allow developers to compete by programming a Tank AI.

The project is built on/adapted from the Unity Tanks! Tutorial project.

So all you have to do is extend a class from TankAI and overwrite the Update function and Awake function to set your tanks name (your Unity forum name).

Once you are happy with your TankAI submit it to the following unity forum.
